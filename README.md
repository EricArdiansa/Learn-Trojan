# Learning Trojan C2 Server

This repositories is created for education purpose only.

Actually i just feel a little bored, then i decide to learn code trojan by myself

so if you see this repo, dont expect to see, cutting edge, tools to hack people.

# Note

i dont know what's wrong with my code, i cant retrieve all file from repository, even after i already using API TOKEN. i assume i have a problem with how i connect my code with my repository, maybe the TOKEN i generated is not compatible.
